Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will.  We praise You.  We bless You.  We adore You.  We glorify You.  We give You thanks for Your great glory.  Lord God, heavenly King, O God almighty Father.

Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son.  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father.  You take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.  You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.  You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.

For You alone are the Holy One.  You alone are the Lord.  You alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ.  With the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father.  Amen.

\gregorioscore{ky--credo_iv--solesmes}
I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.

I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God.  Born of the Father before all ages.  God from God, light from light, true God from true God.  Begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father: through Him all things were made.  For us men, and for our salvation He came down from heaven. \emph{Genuflect until ``and became man''.}  And by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary:  And became man.  For our sake He was crucified: under Pontius Pilate He suffered death, and was buried.  And rose again on the third day, according to the Scriptures.  He ascended into heaven: and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  He will come again in glory, to judge the living and the dead: and His kingdom will have no end.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life:  Who proceeds from the Father and the Son.  Who with the Father and the Son is adored, and glorified:  Who has spoken through the Prophets.  I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic Church.  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.  And I look forward to the resurrection of the dead.  And the life of the world to come.  Amen.
