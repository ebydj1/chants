gregorio and tex files to generate propers and ordinaries as needed for choir work

This repository contains gregorio files pulled from gregobase.selapa.net and some tex wrapper files with translation and
formatting stuff.
Build instructions should (but probably won't) be in each subdirectory. They should be as simple as
`lualatex <tex source file>`, which should ideally build all the gregorio files automatically.

Gregorio is a wonderful chant program available on github here: https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio

Documentation for gregorio is available here: http://gregorio-project.github.io/
