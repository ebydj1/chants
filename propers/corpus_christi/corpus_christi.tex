  \noindent Ego enim accepi a Domino quod et tradidi vobis, quoniam Dominus
  Jesus in qua nocte tradebatur, accepit panem, et gratias agens fregit, et
  dixit: Accipite, et manducate: hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis tradetur:
  hoc facite in meam commemorationem. Similiter et calicem, postquam cœnavit,
  dicens: Hic calix novum testamentum est in meo sanguine: hoc facite
  quotiescumque bibetis, in meam commemorationem. Quotiescumque enim
  manducabitis panem hunc, et calicem bibetis, mortem Domini annuntiabitis donec
  veniat. Itaque quicumque manducaverit panem hunc, vel biberit calicem Domini
  indigne, reus erit corporis et sanguinis Domini. Probet autem seipsum homo: et
  sic de pane illo edat, et de calice bibat. Qui enim manducat et bibit indigne,
  judicium sibi manducat et bibit, non dijudicans corpus Domini.

  \noindent For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
  you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
  and giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which
  shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me. In like
  manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new
  testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the
  commemoration of me. For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the
  chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come. Therefore
  whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily,
  shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove
  himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice. For he
  that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself,
  not discerning the body of the Lord.
