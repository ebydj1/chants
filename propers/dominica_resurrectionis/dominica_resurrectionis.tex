Christians! to the Paschal Victim offer your thankful praises.

The Lamb the sheep redeemeth: Christ, who only is sinless, reconcileth sinners to the Father.

Death and life have contended in that conflict stupendous: the Prince of Life, who died, deathless reigneth.

Speak, Mary, declaring what thou sawest wayfaring.

``The tomb of Christ who now liveth: and likewise the glory of the Risen.

Bright angels attesting, the shroud and napkin resting.

Yea, Christ my hope is arisen: to Galilee He goeth before you.''

We know that Christ is risen, henceforth ever living: Have mercy, Victor King, pardon giving.
