  \mref{Is.~61:10.} I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my soul shall be
  joyful in my God: for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, and
  with the robe of justice he hath covered me, as a bride adorned with her
  jewels. \vref{Ps.~29:2.} I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me:
  and hast not made my enemies to rejoice over me.

  \noindent O God, who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin didst prepare
  a fitting habitation for thy Son; grant, we beseech thee, that as thou
  preservedst her from all stain through the death foreseen of the same thy Son,
  so we too may through her intercession be purified and come to thee.

  \noindent Dominus possedit me in initio viarum suarum, antequam quidquam
  faceret a principio. Ab æ\-ter\-no ordinata sum, et ex antiquis, antequam 
  terra fieret. Nondum erant abyssi et ego iam concepta eram: necdum fontes
  aquarum eruperant: necdum montes gravi mole constiterant: an\-te colles ego
  parturiebar: adhuc terram non fecerat, et flumina, et cardines orbis terræ.
  Quando præparabat cælos, aderam: quando certa lege et gyro vallabat abyssos:
  quando æthera firmabat sursum, et librabat fontes aquarum: quando circumdabat
  mari terminum suum, et legem ponebat aquis, ne transirent fines suos; quando
  appendebat fundamenta terræ. Cum eo eram cuncta componens: et delectabar per
  singulos dies, ludens coram eo omni tempore, ludens in orbe terrarum, et
  deliciæ meæ esse cum filiis hominum. Nunc ergo filii, audite me: Beati, qui
  custodiunt vias meas. Audite disciplinam, et estote sapientes, et nolite
  abiicere eam. Beatus homo qui audit me, et qui vigilat ad fores meas quotidie,
  et observat ad postes ostii mei. Qui me invenerit, inveniet vitam, et hauriet
  salutem a Domino.

  \switchcolumn

  \noindent The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made
  anything, from the beginning. I was set up from eternity, and of old, before
  the earth was made. The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived;
  neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out; the mountains with
  their huge bulk had not as yet been established, before the hills I was
  brought forth. He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles
  of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was present; when with a
  certain law and compass he enclosed the depths; when he established the sky
  above, and poised the fountains of waters; when he compassed the sea with its
  bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits;
  when he balanced the foundations of the earth; I was with him, forming all
  things, and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times, playing
  in the world, and my delights were to be with the children of men. Now,
  therefore, ye children, hear me: blessed art they that keep my ways. Hear
  instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the man that heareth
  me, and that watcheth daily at my gates and waiteth at the posts of my doors.
  He that shall find me shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord.
