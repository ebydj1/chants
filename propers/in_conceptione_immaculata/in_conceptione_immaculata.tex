\textbf{Is. 61:10}. I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my soul shall be
joyful in my God: for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, and
with the robe of jusice he hath covered me, as a bride adorned with her jewels.
\emph{Ps. 29:2} I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me: and hast not
made my enemies to rejoice over me.

\textsc{Collect}. O God, who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin didst
prepare a fitting habitation for thy Son; grant, we beseech thee, that as thou
preservedst her from all stain through the death foreseen of the same thy Son,
so we too may through her intercession be purified and come to thee.
Through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with
thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God, for ever and ever. \Rbar{}. Amen.

\textsc{Lesson}. \textit{Prov. 8:22-35.} The Lord possessed me in the beginning
of his ways, before he made anything, from the beginning. I was set up from
eternity, and of old, before the earth was made. The depths were not as yet, and
I was already conceived; neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out;
the mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been established, before the
hills I was brought forth. He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor
the poles of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was present; when with a
certain law and compass he enclosed the depths; when he established the sky
above, and poised the fountains of waters; when he compassed the sea with its
bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits; when
he balanced the foundations of the earth; I was with him, forming all things,
and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times, playing in the
world, and my delights were to be with the children of men. Now, therefore, ye
children, hear me: blessed art they that keep my ways. Hear instruction, and be
wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the man that heareth me, and that watcheth
daily at my gates and waiteth at the posts of my doors. He that shall find me
shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord.

\textsc{Gospel}. \textit{Lk. 1:26-28.} At that time: The Angel Gabriel was sent
from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
And the Angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is
with thee; blessed art thou among women.

\textsc{Secret}. Receive, O Lord, the saving victim which we offer to thee in
the festival of the Immaculate Conception of the blessed Virgin Mary: and grant
that, even as we proclaim her to have been preserved by thy grace from every
stain, so may we be delivered, by her intercession, from all our sins. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity
of the Holy Ghost, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.

God, heal in us the wounds of that sin from which thou didst by a singular

Lord Jesus Christ, thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of 
the Holy Ghost, one God, for ever and ever. \Rbar{}. Amen.
