%      Don't go overboard, some spacing changes have been known to change the

%   3) Change the annotation to match the Liber Usualis

  \noindent Multifariam, multisque modis olim Deus loquens patribus in
  Prophetis: novissime diebus istis locutus est nobis in Filio, quem constituit
  heredem universorum, per quem fecit et saecula: qui cum sit splendor gloriæ,
  et figura substantia? eius, portansque omnia verbo virtutis suæ, purgationem
  peccatorum faciens, sedet ad dexteram maiestatis in excelsis: tanto melior
  Angelis effectus, quanto differentius præ illis nomen hereditavit. Cui enim
  dixit aliquando Angelorum: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te? Et rursum:
  Ego ero illi in patrem, et ipse erit mihi in filium? Et cum iterum introducit
  Primogenitum in orbem terræ, dicit: Et adorent eum omnes Angeli Dei. Et ad
  Angelos quidem dicit: Qui facit Angelos suos spiritus, et ministros suos
  flammam ignis. Ad Filium autem: Thronus tuus, Deus, in saeculum saeculi: virga
  æquitatis, virga regni tui. Dilexisti iustitiam et odisti iniquitatem:
  propterea unxit te Deus, Deus tuus, oleo exsultationis præ participibus tuis.
  Et: Tu in principio, Domine, terram fundasti: et opera ma\-nu\-um tuarum sunt
  coeli. Ipsi peribunt, tu autem permanebis; et omnes ut vestimentum

  \noindent God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past
  to the fathers by the prophets, last of all, in these days hath spoken to us
  by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made
  the world. Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his
  substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation
  of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high. Being made so much
  better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
  For to which of the angels hath he said at any time, \emph{Thou art my Son, to
  day have I begotten thee?} And again, \emph{I will be to him a Father, and he
  shall be to me a Son?} And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into
  the world, he saith: \emph{And let all the angels of God adore him.} And to
  the angels indeed he saith: \emph{He that maketh his angels spirits, and his
  ministers a flame of fire.} But to the Son: \emph{Thy throne, O God, is for
  ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast
  loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee
  with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.} And: \emph{Thou in the beginning,
  O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.
  They shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a
  garment. And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
  but thou art the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.}

  \noindent In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat
  Verbum. Hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Omnia per ipsum facta sunt: et sine
  ipso factum est nihil, quod factum est: in ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux
  hominum: et lux in tenebris lucet, et tenebræ eam non comprehenderunt. Fuit
  homo missus a Deo, cui nomen erat Ioannes. Hic venit in testimonium, ut
  testimonium perhiberet de lumine, ut omnes crederent per illum. Non erat ille
  lux, sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine. Erat lux vera, quæ illuminat
  omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum. In mundo erat, et mundus per ipsum
  factus est, et mundus eum non cognovit. In propria venit, et sui eum non
  receperunt. Quotquot autem receperunt eum, dedit eis potestatem filios Dei
  fieri, his, qui credunt in nomine eius: qui non ex sanguinibus, neque ex
  voluntate carnis, neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt. Et Verbum

  \noindent In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
  Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
  him: and without him was made nothing that was made. In him was life, and the
  life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
  did not comprehend it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
  This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men
  might believe through him. He was not the light, but was to give testimony of
  the light. That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh
  into this world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
  world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as
  many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons of God, to them
  that believe in his name. Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the
  flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and
  dwelt among us, (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only
  begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
